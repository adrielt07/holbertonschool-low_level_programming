```

## Documentation
- 0-positive_or_negative.c - prints whether the random number in the variable n is positive, negativve or zero
- 1-last_digit.c - prints whether the last digit of random number is greater than 5, is zero or less than 6 but not 0
- 2-print_alphabet.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase. Putchar only
- 3-print_alphabets.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase. Putchar only. Can only use it three times
- 4-print_alphabt.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase except q and e. Putchar only
- 5-print_numbers.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0
- 6-print_numberz.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0. Putchar only. Can only use it twice. Variable with type char is not allowed
- 7-print_tebahpla.c - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse. Putchar only. Can only use it twice
- 8-print_base16.c - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase. Putchar only. Can only use it three times
- 9-print_comb.c - program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by ', ' in ascending order. Putchar only. Can only use putchar four times. Variable of type char is not allowed.
- 10-print_comb2.c - prints the numbers from 00 to 99. Numbers must be separated by ', ' in ascending order with two digits. Putchar only. Can only use putchar five times. Variable of type char is not allowed.
- 100-print_comb3.c - program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. The two digits must be different (01 and 10 are considered the same combination of 0 and 1). Print only the smallest combination of two digits. Putchar only. Allowed to use it five times. Variable of type char is not allowed
- 101-print_comb4.c - prints all possible different combinations of three digits. Same rule as 100-print_comb3 except I can use putchar six times.
