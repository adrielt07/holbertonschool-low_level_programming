## 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
Introduction to C functions and nested loops
Use of standard library is forbidden, unless mentioned.

## Helper Functions
- holberton.h - prototypes of all functions
- putchar.c - same function as stdio.h putchar function

## Tasks:
- 0-holberton.c - program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line
- 1-alphabet.c - function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 2-print_alphabet_x10.c - function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 3-islower.c - function that checks for lowercase character
- 4-isalpha.c - function that checks for alphabetic character.
- 5-sign.c - function that prints the sign (positive, negative or 0) of a number
- 6-abs.c - function that computes the absolute value of an integer
- 7-print_last_digit.c - function that prints the last digit of a number.
- 8-24_hours.c - function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- 9-times_table.c - function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
- 10-add.c - function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- 11-print_to_98.c - function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line. (allowed to use standard library)
- 101-natural.c - program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
- 102-fibonacci.c - program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
- 103-fibonacci.c - By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000. Program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line. (allowed to use standard library)
