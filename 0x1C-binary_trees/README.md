# Binary Trees

### Documentation
-At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Installation
- main folder - contains the example/test files for each function. For example, 0-main.c is a test file for file 0-binary_tree_node.c
- Number correlates to the task number
- From the main folder, compile with the following:
  - gcc <#-main.c> -L. -lBT
  - Task-0 compilation Example: gcc 0-main.c -L. -lBT 
  - Execute: ./a.out

## Operator Instruction
- binary_tree_print.c - prints binary tree for visualisation purpose
- 0-binary_tree_node.c - creates a binary tree node
- 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c - inserts a node as the left-child of another node
- 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c - inserts a node as the right-child of another node
- 3-binary_tree_delete.c - deletes an entire binary tree
- 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c - checks if a node is a leaf
- 5-binary_tree_is_root.c - checks if a given node is a root
- 6-binary_tree_preorder.c - goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
- 7-binary_tree_inorder.c - goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
- 8-binary_tree_postorder.c - goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
- 9-binary_tree_height.c - measures the height of a binary tree
- 10-binary_tree_depth.c - measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
- 11-binary_tree_size.c - measures the size of a binary tree
- 12-binary_tree_leaves.c - counts the leaves in a binary tree
- 13-binary_tree_nodes.c - counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
- 14-binary_tree_balance.c - measures the balance factor of a binary tree
- 15-binary_tree_is_full.c - checks if a binary tree is full
- 16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c - checks if a binary tree is perfect
- 17-binary_tree_sibling.c - finds the sibling of a node
- 18-binary_tree_uncle.c - finds the uncle of a node
- 100-binary_trees_ancestor.c - finds the least common ancestor of two nodes
- 101-binary_tree_levelorder.c - goes through a binary tree using level order traversal
- 102-binary_tree_is_complete.c - checks if a binary tree is complete (broken 7/6/2018)
- 103-binary_tree_rotate_left.c - performs a left-rotation on a binary tree
- 104-binary_tree_rotate_right.c - performs a right-rotation on a binary tree
- 110-binary_tree_is_bst.c - checks if a binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (broken 7/6/2018)
