## Search Algorithm Project
Project about search algorithms and space complexity.
Use of standard libray is forbidden except for printf or stated otherwise.
The tasks are compiled with the main files located in the main folder with correlating number
For exameple, compile 0-linear.c with 0-main.c file
- gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o 0-linear

## Tasks
- search_algos.h - header file that contains the function prototypes
- 0-linear.c - Searches an array using linear search algorithm.
- 1-binary.c - Searches a sorted array of integers using Binary Search Algorithm
- 2-O - Worst case time complexity of a linear search
- 3-O - Worst case space complexity of a iterative linear search
- 4-O - Worst case time complexity of a binary search in an array
- 5-O - Worst case space complexity of a binary search in an array
- 6-O - Space complexity of the function below:
- 100-jump.c - seraches a sorted array using jump search algorithm
- 101-O - avarage case time complexity of a jump search in an array using step = sqrt(n)
- 102-interpolation.c - searches a sorted array using interpolation search algorithm
